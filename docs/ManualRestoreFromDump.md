# Restoring a Galera Cluster from a Database Dump

  When working with a Galera Cluster, itâ€™s important to consider certain limitations. Only InnoDB tables are replicated across nodes. 
Tables using other storage engines, such as *mysql.** tables (which typically use the Aria/MyISAM engines) are not replicated. 
This means changes to these tables are not automatically synchronized and may lead to inconsistencies.

## Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Load the Database Dump to /tmp/ dorectory on the Master Node
Upload the dump file to the master node using:
  - a File Manager interface.
  - an SFTP.

2. Restore the dump by running the following command:
  mysql -u<username> -p<password> < /tmp/db_backup.sql
  Replace <username> and <password> with your database credentials.

Alternatively, use tools like phpMyAdmin for an interactive restoration.

3. Stop Services on Non-Master Nodes
SSH into each Non-Master node using WebSSH or an SSH client.
Run the following command to stop the MariaDB service:
sudo jem service stop

4. Delete the grastate.dat File on Non-Master nodes
Access each non-master node via SSH or a File Manager and remove the Galera state file:
/var/lib/mysql/grastate.dat
This ensures the node will initiate a full state transfer (SST) upon service restart.

5. Start Services on Non-Master Nodes
On each non-master node, start the MariaDB service by running:
sudo jem service start
The non-master nodes will initiate a full SST from the master node, synchronizing all data.

## Key Considerations
Replication of InnoDB Only: Galera Cluster only replicates InnoDB tables. Tables using other storage engines, such as Aria or MyISAM (e.g., mysql.* tables), are not replicated. Ensure you manually synchronize such tables across nodes if required.

Cluster Downtime: During this process, the cluster may experience downtime. Plan accordingly to minimize impact on applications relying on the database.

SST Method: Ensure the SST method configured for your cluster (e.g., xtrabackup or rsync) is functioning correctly to facilitate successful synchronization.

By following these steps, you can restore your Galera cluster from a database dump and ensure all nodes are synchronized while accounting for the non-replication of tables using storage engines other than InnoDB.
